<h1>Before You Begin</h1>
<p>
If you want to use Coldfire debugger, you will require a m68k toolchain before build
and debug any Coldfire related project.
The debugger provides integration with GNU m68k toolchain, including make, gcc compiler,
gdb debugger and Coldfire programmer. The default setting for Coldfire project 
builder needs GNU m68k-coff toolchain to make an coff object file capable to download
into target.</p><p>
The Coldfire debugger designed to work under Linux and Windows but you can change
some minors to make it compatible with other platforms.</p><br />
<h3>Windows</h3><p>
For windows the main choice is MinGW (Cygwin is also supported). MinGW is a port
of GNU toolchain to the Windows platform. The m68k-coff toolchain is provided by
the Coldfire debugger plugin. MinGW provides the best integration with this plugin
due to its great compability with the CDT.</p><p>
The following are MinGW installation instructions. Notice that the links may change
over time as new versions come out.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and run the MinGW setup program,
  (<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe">
  MinGW-5.1.3.exe</a>).
  <li>You may select the Current or Candidate version of these tools.</li>
  <li>The MinGW setup program currently does not install the gdb bdm debugger.
  Thus the Coldfire debugger provides  m68k-coff-gdb inside its archive. If you want
  different format of image files (e.g. ELF format), change the program directory
  from the Coldfire Debugger preferences page. The exact steps to change this path
  is provided in the reference section.
</ol> 
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>For Linux platform the toolchain installation is too easy as you can download
latest m68k-elf toolchain from the uClinux website:</p>
<a href="http://www.uclinx.org/downloads">uClinux download directory (inaccurate)</a>.
<p><b>It is recommended  to use Linux instead of windows. It is more comfortable than
windows environment.</b></p>
