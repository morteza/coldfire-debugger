<h1>Coldfire Debugger User Guide</h1>
<p>The Coldfire Debugger is a collection of Eclipse-based plugins
that provides the capability to create, build, download into boards 
and debug projects that use C and/or C++ as a programming language 
capable to run under the Coldfire architecture processors.</p>

<p>The Coldfire Debugger does not include the necessary compilers and 
debuggers to compile and debug C/C++ codes. But you can customize these plugins 
to work with any types of compilers and programmers. This allows you to mix and
match such tools depending on your project requirements.</p>

<p>The default settings do provide support for integration with the GNU tools 
for build and debug. Please see the <a href="cfd_before_begin.htm">Before You Begin</a> section for installation instructions.</p>
